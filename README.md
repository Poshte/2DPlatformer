# 2D Platformer Game

## Overview

This project is a work in progress developed in Unity, featuring a custom physics system designed to enhance gameplay mechanics. 

## Features

- **Custom Physics System**: Designed to handle complex interactions such as moving platforms and how they behave when transferring a passenger, climbing and descending slopes and tight controls that give you the feeling of total agency.

- **Dialogue System**: Interactive dialogue system and player's diary that has been coded from scratch to enhance storytelling and player engagement.

## Current Status

This project is still under development. Currently looking for an artist to collaborate with who is passionate about indie game development and can provide me with graphics and animations :)
